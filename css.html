About Chairman:<br><br>

<br>
   S<br>ri Lakireddy Bali Reddy, an Indo-american entrepreneur, philanthropist hails from Velvadam, a village in the Mylavaram mandal of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh. A meritorious student throughout his academic career, he graduated from Osmania University with a Gold medal in B.E in Chemical Engineering. Soon after, he went to the University of California at Berkeley on a scholarship in 1960 and completed MS in Chemical Engineering.
   A man<br> of boundless energy and ideas, he envisioned himself in the role of an entrepreneur in the hotel and real estate business. Within a few decades, through sheer hard work and determination, he was successful in establishing a flourishing business empire. A man with considerable compassion and generosity, he took immense pleasure in doing many acts of charity and philanthropy that benefited his beloved place of birth and its people. He set up Lakireddy Bali Reddy Charitable Trust, a non-profit organization fully funded by him in order to channelize the multi-faceted philanthropic activities towards the socio-economic and educational development of this region of Krishna District.
   He strive<br>d to improve the lot of the poor and helpless as well. Some of his notable philanthropic activities include:

Providin<br><br>g free eye care services including free cataract surgery with lens implants

   In 1998, against many odds<br>, he founded the Lakireddy Bali Reddy college of Engineering with the able support of his younger sibling, Sri Lakireddy Jayaprakash Reddy. And as its chairman, he made it blossom into a thriving center of technical education for providing quality education and employment opportunities to the young. True to his vision, the college is marching ahead as a top ranked Technical institute in the state of Andhra Pradesh that takes pride for its best-in-class infrastructure, excellent academic ambience and robust research potential.
   The octogenarian NRI philanthrvopist, Sri Bali Reddy beautifully lives the tag of the son of the soil by holding his beloved birthplace and people very close to his heart.
